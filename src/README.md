## Project Source Hierachy

Project Hierachy Structure should look like this:

```
src/
    assets          # Asset files including images, fonts, etc.
    components      # Component elements for constructing containers or used as stand-alone object 
    containers      # Containers for higher abstractioin of view
    helpers         # Helper classes for React
    utils           # Collection of utility functions
    index.js        # JavaScript entry point
    index.css       # Global CSS used in index.js
    README.md       # this file
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.
